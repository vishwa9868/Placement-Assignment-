    "ANS:-The purpose of Python's Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is to provide a programming paradigm that organizes code into reusable objects with their own properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods). OOP allows you to structure your code in a way that models real-world entities or concepts, making it easier to manage complexity, promote code reuse, and improve code maintainability.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Modularity and Reusability: OOP allows you to break down a problem into smaller, self-contained objects. These objects can be reused in different parts of your code or in other projects, promoting modularity and reducing code duplication.\n",
    "\n",
    "Encapsulation: OOP encapsulates data (attributes) and methods (functions) into objects, allowing you to control access to data and provide a clear interface for interacting with objects. Encapsulation helps with code organization, data integrity, and information hiding.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance: OOP supports inheritance, which enables the creation of new classes (child classes) based on existing classes (parent classes). Inheritance allows child classes to inherit attributes and methods from parent classes, facilitating code reuse and promoting hierarchical relationships between objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Polymorphism: Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be used interchangeably based on a shared interface or superclass. This concept enables flexibility and allows you to write code that can work with different types of objects, enhancing code extensibility and adaptability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Code Maintainability: OOP promotes clean code organization and separation of concerns. With well-designed classes and objects, code becomes easier to understand, modify, and maintain. OOP principles, such as encapsulation and abstraction, can also improve code documentation and readability."

    "Instance Binding: When a method is called on an instance object, the instance itself is automatically passed as the first argument to the method. By convention, this argument is named self, although you can technically choose any name you prefer (although it is strongly recommended to stick with self for consistency and readability).\n",

    "Accessing Instance Attributes: Using the self argument, you can access the instance's attributes within the method. For example, if the instance has an attribute named color, you can access it using self.color within the method. This allows methods to retrieve and modify the state of the specific instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Invoking Other Instance Methods: The self argument enables you to invoke other methods defined within the same class on the instance. By using self.method_name(), you can call other instance methods and perform more complex operations or encapsulate related functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "Creating and Modifying Instance Attributes: Within a method, you can create new instance attributes or modify existing ones using the self argument. For example, you can assign a value to a new attribute using self.attribute_name = value. This allows methods to update the state of the instance during execution.\n",
